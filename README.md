Stores the basic models I've worked on.

1. https://github.com/anishmo99/Machine-Learning-On-Google-Colab/blob/master/fuelPolynomial81_69.ipynb is a basic polynomial regression model with an accuracy of 81.69%. It is based on the CO2 emission of a car depending on various features

2. https://github.com/anishmo99/Machine-Learning-On-Google-Colab/blob/master/carPricePredictionEdited.ipynb is a multilinear regression model with an R-squared value of 0.912, explaining 90% of the variance. Contains the minimum variables having maximum significance in the model. This forked Kaggle Notebook has helped me clear my doubts and taught a lot about data preprocessing and data visualisation :  https://www.kaggle.com/anishmookherjee/carprice-prediction-mlr-rfe-vif-edited
